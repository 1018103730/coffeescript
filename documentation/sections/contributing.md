## Contributing 
Contributions are welcome, feel free to fork a copy and submit a pull request.

If there is a core part of ECMAScript you think we are missing, head on over to [CoffeeScript issues on GitHub](http://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/issues), and dig around in the open and closed issues. 

For more resources on adding to CoffeeScript, please see [the Wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/%5BHowto%5D-Hacking-on-the-CoffeeScript-Compiler) or [How The Parser Works](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/%5BHowTo%5D-How-parsing-works) if you are interested in learning how the parser works. 

There are several things you can do to increase your odds of having the pull request accepted: 

  * Create tests! Any pull request should probably include basic tests to verify you didn't break anything, or future changes won't break your code.
  * Follow the CoffeeScript style guide
  * Ensure any ECMAScript addition is mature (at Stage 4), with no further potential syntax changes.
  * Adding only the features that help the community rather than a specific use case.

Of course, it's entirely possible that you have a great addition, but it doesn't fit directly with the CoffeeScript code base. 

This might be the time to... 

## Roll Your Own 

You are of course, welcome to fork the language and add in the features you want. There are [quite a few](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/In-The-Wild) really interesting projects that have done so, and more are welcome.
