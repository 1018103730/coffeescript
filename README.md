# illiterate.js

The purpose of this package is to extract code blocks from markdown files, so that you can write your source code in your markdown docs akin to literate coffeescript, but for any language.

The implementation should be fairly robust, relying on a markdown parser rather than indentation.

The [self documenting source code](src/illiterate.js.md) should explain the rest in more detail.
